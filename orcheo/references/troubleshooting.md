# Troubleshooting

## Workflow uploading or running issues

Orcheo validates uploaded LangGraph scripts in a RestrictedPython sandbox.
Rejections usually mean the script uses syntax, imports, or runtime behavior
outside the sandbox policy.

What is allowed:
- Python code compiled with RestrictedPython plus async functions, `await`, and
  annotated assignments.
- Imports from allow-listed module prefixes only:
  `json`, `langgraph`, `langchain*`, `orcheo`, `typing*`, `collections`,
  `dataclasses`, `datetime`, `functools`, `html`, `itertools`, `math`,
  `operator`, `pydantic`, `uuid`.
- Standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` guards (the sandbox sets `__name__` to
  `"__orcheo_ingest__"`, so guarded blocks do not run).

What is blocked or constrained:
- Importing non-allow-listed modules (for example `os`, `subprocess`, `socket`,
  or third-party packages outside the list).
- Relative imports (`from .foo import bar`).
- Scripts exceeding configured size or execution timeout limits.

How to fix common failures:
- `Import of module ... is not permitted`: replace the dependency with an
  allow-listed module or move the logic into Orcheo/server-side code.
- `Relative imports are not supported`: change to absolute imports from an
  allow-listed package.
- `script exceeds size limit` (wording may vary): remove dead code, trim large
  constants/embedded assets, and move bulky data or helper logic into
  versioned modules imported from allow-listed packages.
- Timeout errors (for example `execution timed out`): reduce per-step work,
  split the graph into smaller nodes, or move long-running logic outside
  ingestion-time script execution.
