# Orcheo

Instructions for Orcheo CLI booting, configuration, local services, operations, and coding workflows.
When you need command details, use `orcheo --help` or `orcheo <subcommand> --help`.

## Quick start

1. Run [booting.md](./references/booting.md) first.
2. After booting succeeds, load only the reference file needed for the user request.

## Reference map

Use [REFERENCE.md](./references/REFERENCE.md) as the index of all Orcheo skill
guides, then open only the specific page needed for the current user request.

## Scope and rules

- Use only PyPI-based compose workflows for local services in this skill.
- Ask for confirmation before package installation, compose up/down, auth login, or file changes.
- Prefer concise, copy-pasteable commands.
